# Analysis

## Explanation
We used *many* different MATLAB scripts to search for trends and emergent behavior, not all of which was found or included in the final publication. However, for completion, all files for trend analysis and diagram generation are included. Some excessively large data files were not included, despite being referenced for analysis and diagram generation. The simulations to generate these files will need to be appropriately re-run to access the output data.
